{\bf Effective learners} regularly self-assess their progress and then adjust study strategies in response. This reflection will help you to analyze your week's performance and help you on your path to improving your learning strategies.

\item How many hours did you schedule for MTH 415 study this week? How many hours did you actually study this week? Suggestions for improvement, if appropriate.
\vfill
I spent close to 3 hours ``working" on topology. Of those 3 around 2 of them were intense and focused. I plan on setting 6-8pm my designated topology time at least three or four times a week.
\item How many hours did you participate during online office hours? Suggestions for improvement, if appropriate.
\vfill
I went to one, but was not able to stay long.

\newpage
The next few sections are for long-form responses. They involve working on your Mathematical Present, making connections with your Mathematical Past, and grasping towards your Mathematical Future.

\section*{Active Reading:}

I spent some time reading chapter 5 on Metrics, Metric Spaces, and Metrizability. \\
\\
I feel like Metric Spaces is just a Real Analysis topic applied to Topology. (Or maybe it's the other way around)\\
\\
I guess one could think of a metric in Real Analysis as more as applied topology. Since topology is the more general topic in this case.\\
\\
I think metric spaces are pretty cool. They seem to have all the nice properties that $ R^n $ has. $ R^n $ is familiar and easier to visualize. I notice that many proofs that I am trying to come up with get drawn as something that reminds me of $ R^n $. After I visualize it, I make it more general and apply to the topology on hand. It really helps in the proof writing process.\\
\\
I find metrizability to be very interesting. Its cool to learn about how we can interact with spaces and relate them to others.


\section*{Error-Analysis:}
I have made the mistake several times now on saying the preimage versus the inverse of. I also made the mistake on the exact definition of the preimage. I've said a couple times now that the preimage of a function $f:X\to Y$ is $\{f^{-1}(y)|y\in Y\}$, which is very much backwards. \\
\\
The preimage of a function $f:X\to Y$ for a point $ y\in Y $ is $ \{x\in X|f(x)=y\} $\\
\\
I need to practice drawing topologies and thinking about quotient spaces. They have been giving me troubles and I am getting frustrated with them.
\section*{Consumers to Producers:}
I added to my stack of definitions the new terms in section 5.1 and 5.3. This is useful as it allows me to self test myself and make sure I really know my definitions.\\
I need to be working on creating my writing projects. I have done very little thought into what I would like to write about.

\section*{Failing \& Succeeding}
I'd say this week was diffidently better than last weeks. I was able to enjoy my time more in the evenings and not feel so stressed out and stuck. I moved back into an apartment in La Crosse and it's been nice to see my buddies.\\
\\
So now that online classes are in full swing, I found that I really do not do well with them. I really miss the support system of talking with classmates and dropping in at office hours. I wish the semester was back to normal. \\
\\
I'm thinking I might need to reduce my hours at work. Or maybe work harder? I'm not sure. I feel like I still have plenty of free time (provided I manage my time well), but I am unable to make great progress on any of my homeworks. \\
\\
There just seems to be a lot of resistance and lack of momentum when working on all my assignments from home. I'm not sure what to do about it.\\

\section*{Notes to Yourself:}
With you new job coming up you'll need to focus and work harder during the given times. It'll be a stressful few weeks here and I want you to push through it.\\
\\
Work harder in shorter bursts, rather than all day semi-working/looking at others things. If I can put in the needed effort and blast through any roadblocks this homework shouldn't take that long. I've felt like there have been a lack of direction and energy in my work. I miss others and do better when I can still see my friends. \\
\\
You're behind. Not in the sense you can't complete everything with more effort, but it's going to be a difficult week. Once we get through it, and you focus on what's important, we should be a much better spot.\\
